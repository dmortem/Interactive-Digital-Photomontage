# Interactive Digital Photomontage
ZJU Computational Photography Course Project 
## Objectives：
Implemented an interactive image fusing software system based on alogorithms including Graph Cut Optimization and Gradient Domain Fusion
## Methods:
•	Implemented an interactive brush between multiply images with Qt.
•	Implemented graph cut optimization to minimize the energy function.
•	Solved Poisson Equation of gradients between pixels with Sparse Matrix and Gauss-Seidel Method.
## Environment
Windows 10, Visual Studio 2015 Community
